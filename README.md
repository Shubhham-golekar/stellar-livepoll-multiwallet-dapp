## 🚀 Stellar Live Poll – Multi-Wallet Smart Contract dApp

A decentralized live polling application built on Stellar Testnet using Soroban smart contracts, StellarWalletsKit, and real-time event synchronization.

This project demonstrates multi-wallet integration, smart contract deployment, transaction tracking, and real-time blockchain event handling.

## 🌍 Overview

Stellar Live Poll is a transparent, on-chain voting application where:

Users connect using multiple Stellar wallets

Votes are recorded on the blockchain

Results update in real-time

Transaction status is tracked

Critical wallet and transaction errors are handled gracefully

## ✨ Features
🔐 Multi-Wallet Integration

Integrated using StellarWalletsKit

Supports:

Freighter

Albedo (optional)

🧠 Smart Contract (Soroban)

Poll initialized on-chain

Votes stored on-chain

Events emitted on every vote

Results fetched from blockchain

## 📡 Real-Time Event Handling

Listens to contract events

UI auto-refreshes when votes are cast

No manual reload required

## 🔄 Transaction Status Tracking

🟡 Pending

🟢 Success

🔴 Failed

❗ Error Handling (Mandatory)

Wallet not installed

Transaction rejected by user

Insufficient balance

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Functions
init_poll(question: String)
vote(option: u32)
get_results() -> Vec<u32>

## 🔁 User Flow

User opens application

Connects wallet via StellarWalletsKit

Poll question loads from contract

User casts vote

Transaction status is displayed

Smart contract emits event

UI updates in real-time

## 🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stellar-livepoll-multiwallet-dapp.git
cd stellar-livepoll-multiwallet-dapp
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install
3️⃣ Run Development Server
npm run dev

## App runs on:

http://localhost:5173/
🔗 Smart Contract Deployment

## Contract deployed on Stellar Testnet using Soroban CLI.

Network: Testnet
RPC: https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

After deployment, update:

src/contract/config.js

With your deployed CONTRACT_ID.

## 🧪 Error Handling Implementation
Error Type	Handling
Wallet Not Found	Display alert & disable interaction
User Rejected	Show transaction failed message
Insufficient Balance	Prevent vote & show warning
📊 Transaction Status Logic

Each vote shows:

setStatus("pending")
setStatus("success")
setStatus("failed")

Displayed clearly in UI.

🔔 Real-Time Event Sync

Contract emits event on vote

## Frontend listens using:

RPC event subscription

Poll refresh logic

UI updates automatically
